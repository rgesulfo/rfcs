# Summary

As part of our effort to promote plugins usage and creation in Strapi, the Expansion Squad (part of the Strapi product team) is working on making plugin development easier and clearer, as well as ensure the best user experience. We are currently working on a validation process to showcase verified plugins on our future web and in-app marketplaces. One of the criteria will be to follow the design guidelines proposed below. 


# Motivation

Strapi's community is growing fast. Its needs are becoming more and more diverse and complex. And more talented developers are jumping in. To unleash this potential we want to create and support a strong plugin ecosystem. This will enable the community to solve specific problems and tap new opportunities. 

To ensure the best experience for plugin users and developers, we would like to introduce design guidelines to provide clarity about what is expected from plugins.

# Detailed design

Describe the proposal in details:

- Explaining the design so that someone who knows Strapi can understand and someone who works on it can implement the proposal. 
- Think about edge-cases and include examples.

# Tradeoffs

What potential tradeoffs are involved with this proposal.

- Complexity
- Work load of implementation
- Can this be implemented outside of Strapi's core packages
- How does this proposal integrate with the current features being implemented
- Cost of migrating existing Strapi applications (is it a breaking change?)
- Does implementing this proposal mean reworking teaching resources (videos, tutorials, documentations)?

# Alternatives

A radical alternative would be to not have any design guidelines.

# Unresolved questions

* Injection zones: what are the use cases?
